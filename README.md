This repo contains the [fsl.tools](https://fsl.tools/) website.  It doesn't contain actual FSL stuff, which can be found [here on the website, instead](https://fsl.tools/#tools).

Mostly you should probably be looking at the [fslp](https://github.com/StoneCypher/fslp) parser repo, or the [jssm](https://github.com/StoneCypher/jssm) state machine engine repo.
